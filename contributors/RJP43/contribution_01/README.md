# REDACTED Unions
  
  I am Rebecca J. Parker. I was born on December 14th, 1990. In my baby book there is a news article from the day of my birth discussing President H.W. Bush's next steps for [Desert storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War) - an article published less than 50 days before his 1991 State of the Union Address. My first SOTU address lasted approximately 48 minutes and contained 3,823 words. And at only 46 days old, I don't recall a single one or any of those in reaction.  
  
  However, Somewhere in my memory I do recall those now infamous words spoken by our president - Bill Clinton - just 2,554 days later.  [“I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.”](http://time.com/3677042/clinton-lewinsky-response/). 
  
In sixth grade, my proudest accomplishment was being Vice President of Adlai Stevenson Elementary School Student Government. George W. Bush was president and anyone that asked me knew I aspired to move straight from my vice presidency into his office.
