- It appears that the live server is already using version 3.5.2 of R. I'm not sure whether this happened in my usual apt-update/upgrade process or what. I'm currently updating the packages (through RStudio at compute-r.sotu-db.com, for simplicity's sake) and then I think will need to copy the updated versions from the user to the global package library.
- using sudo cp /home/r-user/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.5 /usr/lib/R/library/ -r
- beginning to make a bar of dropdown items to select the corpus size
