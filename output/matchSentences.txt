 And tonight I'm back to offer you my plans as well.
 So, tonight I feel as if I'm returning home to friends.
 We're fortunate -- a much changed landscape lies before us tonight.
And so, tonight we must take a strong America and make it even better.  Some people find that agenda impossible, but I'm presenting to you tonight a realistic plan for tackling it.
I make this pledge tonight: My team and I are ready to work with the Congress, to form a special leadership group, to negotiate in good faith, to work day and night -- if that's what it takes -- to meet the budget targets and to produce a budget on time.
 And I ask the Congress tonight to approve several measures which will make budgeting more sensible.
So, tonight I'm proposing the following initiatives: the beginning of a dollars 500 million program to reward America's best schools, merit schools; the creation of special Presidential awards for the best teachers in every State, because excellence should be rewarded; the establishment of a new program of National Science Scholars, one each year for every Member of the House and Senate, to give this generation of students a special incentive to excel in science and mathematics; the expanded use of magnet schools, which give families and students greater choice; and a new program to encourage alternative certification, which will let talented people from all fields teach in our classrooms. " And tonight, I'd ask you to join me by becoming the "Education Congress.
 And I am asking tonight for an increase of almost a billion dollars in budget outlays to escalate the war against drugs.
 And so, tonight I'm calling for the indefinite postponement of three lease sales which have raised troubling questions, two off the coast of California and one which could threaten the Everglades in Florida.
There's another issue that I've decided to mention here tonight.
I should be clear on the conditions attached to my recommendation for the coming year: The savings must be allocated to those priorities for investing in our future that I've spoken about tonight.
Securing a more peaceful world is perhaps the most important priority I'd like to address tonight.
 He was speaking of his country, decades ago, but his words speak to each of us in America tonight.
And to the young people of America, who sometimes feel left out, I ask you tonight to give us the benefit of your talent and energy through a new program called YES, for Youth Entering Service to America.
To the families of America watching tonight in your living rooms, hold fast to your dreams because ultimately America's future rests in your hands.
Recalling anniversaries may not be my specialty in speeches -- [laughter] -- but tonight is one of some note.  On February 9th, 1941, just 48 years ago tonight, Sir Winston Churchill took to the airwaves during Britain's hour of peril.
Tonight, almost half a century later, our peril may be less immediate, but the need for perseverance and clear-sighted fortitude is just as great.  Well, tonight I remain full of hope.
