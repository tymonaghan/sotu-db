All of us are aware of the punishing inflation which has for the first time in 60 years held to double-digit figures for 2 years in a row.
There are a number of subsidies to business and industry that I believe are unnecessary, not because the activities being subsidized aren't of value, but because the marketplace contains incentives enough to warrant continuing these activities without a government subsidy.
I know that you're all aware—but I think it bears saying again—that since 1970 the Soviet Union has invested $300 billion more in its military forces than we have.
This 3-year reduction will also apply to the tax on unearned income, leading toward an eventual elimination of the present differential between the tax on earned and unearned income.
I'm well aware that there are many other desirable and needed tax changes, such as indexing the income tax brackets to protect taxpayers against inflation; the unjust discrimination against married couples if both are working and earning; tuition tax credits; the unfairness of the inheritance tax, especially to the family-owned farm and the family-owned business; and a number of others.
We honor the giants of our history not by going back but forward to the dreams their vision foresaw.
The time has come to proceed toward a great new challenge—a second American Revolution of hope and opportunity; a revolution carrying us to new heights of progress by pushing back frontiers of knowledge and space; a revolution of spirit that taps the soul of America, enabling us to summon greater strength than we've ever known; and a revolution that carries beyond our shores the golden promise of human freedom in a world of peace.
Already, pushing down tax rates has freed our economy to vault forward to record growth.
Tax simplification will be a giant step toward unleashing the tremendous pent-up power of our economy.
To move steadily toward a balanced budget, we must also lighten government's claim on our total economy.
We must go forward in our commitment to the new basics, giving parents greater authority and making sure good teachers are rewarded for hard work and achievement through merit pay.
Since 1981 we've been committed to seeking fair and verifiable arms agreements that would lower the risk of war and reduce the size of nuclear arsenals.
Your vote this spring on the Peacekeeper missile will be a critical test of our resolve to maintain the strength we need and move toward mutual and verifiable arms reductions.
For the past 20 years we've believed that no war will be launched as long as each side knows it can retaliate with a deadly counterstrike.
Well, I believe there's a better way of eliminating the threat of nuclear war.
Some say it will bring war to the heavens, but its purpose is to deter war in the heavens and on Earth.
And many Presidents have come to this Chamber in times of great crisis: war and depression, loss of national spirit.
And we're a forward-looking nation -- generous, yes, but ambitious, not for ourselves but for the world.
We must reward excellence and cut through bureaucracy.
So, tonight I'm proposing the following initiatives: the beginning of a $500 million program to reward America's best schools, merit schools; the creation of special Presidential awards for the best teachers in every State, because excellence should be rewarded; the establishment of a new program of National Science Scholars, one each year for every Member of the House and Senate, to give this generation of students a special incentive to excel in science and mathematics; the expanded use of magnet schools, which give families and students greater choice; and a new program to encourage alternative certification, which will let talented people from all fields teach in our classrooms.
And I am asking tonight for an increase of almost a billion dollars in budget outlays to escalate the war against drugs.
The war must be waged on all fronts.
But for all we do in law enforcement, in interdiction and treatment, we will never win this war on drugs unless we stop the demand for drugs.
But I've personally assured General Secretary Gorbachev that at the conclusion of such a review we will be ready to move forward.
And I look forward to meeting with our NATO partners in the near future.
Let them look back and say that we had the foresight to understand that a time of peace and prosperity is not the time to rest but a time to press forward, a time to invest in the future.
And tomorrow the debate on the plan I've put forward begins, and I ask the Congress to come forward with your own proposals.
And Churchill responded on this night by radio broadcast to a nation at war, but he directed his words to Franklin Roosevelt.
Nineteen forty-five provided the common frame of reference, the compass points of the postwar era we've relied upon to understand ourselves.
The cornerstones of this free society have already been set in place: democracy, competition, opportunity, private investment, stewardship, and of course leadership.
We need to cut the tax on capital gains, encourage risktakers, especially those in our small businesses, to take those steps that translate into economic reward, jobs, and a better life for all of us.
And there's something more we owe the generations of the future: stewardship, the safekeeping of America's precious environmental inheritance.
We've got to step forward when there's trouble, lend a hand, be what I call a point of light to a stranger in need.
It's time to build on our new relationship with the Soviet Union, to endorse and encourage a peaceful process of internal change toward democracy and economic opportunity.
And all kids are unique, and yet all kids are alike -- the budding young environmentalists I met this month who joined me in exploring the Florida Everglades; the little leaguers I played catch with in Poland, ready to go from Warsaw to the World Series; and even the kids who are ill or alone -- and God bless those boarder babies, born addicted to drugs and AIDS and coping with problems no child should have to face.
The end of the cold war has been a victory for all humanity.
We in this Union enter the last decade of the 20th century thankful for our blessings, steadfast in our purpose, aware of our difficulties, and responsive to our duties at home and around the world.
Everyone who steps forward today -- to get one addict off drugs, to convince one troubled teenager not to give up on life, to comfort one AIDS patient, to help one hungry child.
We can find meaning and reward by serving some higher purpose than ourselves, a shining purpose, the illumination of a Thousand Points of Light.
It is the individual -- the individual who steps forward.
And that's why, amid all the sound and fury of last year's budget debate, we put into law new, enforceable spending caps, so that future spending debates will mean a battle of ideas, not a bidding war.
That requires a forward-looking plan of action, and that's exactly what we will be sending to the Congress.
And with a Mexican free trade agreement and our Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, we can help our partners strengthen their economies and move toward a free trade zone throughout this entire hemisphere.
The value, the value of this turnover approach is straightforward.
As Americans, we know that there are times when we must step forward and accept our responsibility to lead the world away from the dark chaos of dictators, toward the brighter promise of a better day.
The war in the Gulf is not a war we wanted.
We worked hard to avoid war.
Iraq's capacity to sustain war is being destroyed.
And we all realize that our responsibility to be the catalyst for peace in the region does not end with the successful conclusion of this war.
Looking forward, I have directed that the SDI program be refocused on providing protection from limited ballistic missile strikes, whatever their source.
Norman Schwarzkopf.
We are all very grateful to General Schwarzkopf and to all those serving with him.
Schwarzkopf: Alma Powell, the wife of the distinguished Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
The courage and success of the RAF pilots, of the Kuwaiti, Saudi, French, the Canadians, the Italians, the pilots of Qatar and Bahrain -- all are proof that for the first time since World War II, the international community is united.
And if he thinks that by abusing the coalition prisoners of war he will benefit, he is dead wrong.
And when we do, the world community will have sent an enduring warning to any dictator or despot, present or future, who contemplates outlaw aggression.
The world can, therefore, seize this opportunity to fulfill the long-held promise of a new world order, where brutality will go unrewarded and aggression will meet collective resistance.
This nation has never found glory in war.
We move toward the next century more confident than ever that we have the will at home and abroad to do what must be done -- the hard work of freedom.
President, distinguished Members of Congress, honored guests, and fellow citizens:    Thank you very much for that warm reception.
[Laughter]    I mean to speak tonight of big things, of big changes and the promises they hold, and of some big problems and how, together, we can solve them and move our country forward as the undisputed leader of the age.
But the biggest thing that has happened in the world in my life, in our lives, is this: By the grace of God, America won the cold war.
Now we can look homeward even more and move to set right what needs to be set right.
For the cold war didn't end; it was won.
And they won't have, as my children did, air raid drills in which they crawl under their desks and cover their heads in case of nuclear war.
A few days after the war began, I received a telegram from Joanne Speicher, the wife of the first pilot killed in the Gulf, Lieutenant Commander Scott Speicher.
But when the war began, you put partisanship aside, and we supported our troops.
We will cease production of new warheads for our sea-based ballistic missiles.
I've informed President Yeltsin that if the Commonwealth, the former Soviet Union, will eliminate all land-based multiple-warhead ballistic missiles, I will do the following: We will eliminate all Peacekeeper missiles.
We will reduce the number of warheads on Minuteman missiles to one and reduce the number of warheads on our sea-based missiles by about one-third.
And we can move toward a nationalized system, a system which will restrict patient choice in picking a doctor and force the Government to ration services arbitrarily.
But we have to go back to the insight of Franklin Roosevelt who, when he spoke of what became the welfare program, warned that it must not become "a narcotic" and a "subtle destroyer" of the spirit.
You know, it's kind of an American tradition to show a certain skepticism toward our democratic institutions.
And we propose new rewards for entrepreneurs who take new risks.
If we believe in jobs and we believe in learning, we must believe in rewarding work.
We will reward the work of millions of working poor Americans by realizing the principle that if you work 40 hours a week and you've got a child in the house, you will no longer be in poverty.
As we restructure our military forces to meet the new threats of the post-cold-war world, it is true that we can responsibly reduce our defense budget.
Our plan seeks to attack tax subsidies that actually reward companies more for shutting their operations down here and moving them overseas than for staying here and reinvesting in America.
As we move toward the 4th year, with the explosion in health care costs, as I said, projected to account for 50 percent of the growth of the deficit between now and the year 2000, there must be planned cuts in payments to providers, to doctors, to hospitals, to labs, as a way of controlling health care costs.
Once Americans looked forward to doubling their living standards every 25 years.
If we work hard and if we work together, if we rededicate ourselves to creating jobs, to rewarding work, to strengthening our families, to reinventing our Government, we can lift our country's fortunes again.
With the cold war receding and global commerce at record levels, we are helping to win an unrivaled peace and prosperity all across the world.
We should reward and recognize our best teachers, and as we reward them, we should quickly and fairly remove those few who don't measure up.
One of the greatest sources of our strength throughout the cold war was a bipartisan foreign policy.
And I ask you to mount a full-scale assault on juvenile crime with legislation that declares war on gangs with new prosecutors and tougher penalties; extends the Brady bill so violent teen criminals will not be able to buy handguns; requires child safety locks on handguns to prevent unauthorized use; and helps to keep our schools open after hours, on weekends, and in the summer, so our young people will have someplace to go and something to say yes to.
Fifty years ago, a farsighted America led in creating the institutions that secured victory in the cold war and built a growing world economy.
Americans fought three wars in Asia in this century.
Together with South Korea, we must advance peace talks with North Korea and bridge the cold war's last divide.
We have no more important obligations, especially in the wake of what we now know about the Gulf war.
Yet international affairs spending today is just one percent of the Federal budget, a small fraction of what America invested in diplomacy to choose leadership over escapism at the start of the cold war.
Almost exactly 50 years ago, in the first winter of the cold war, President Truman stood before a Republican Congress and called upon our country to meet its responsibilities of leadership.
He was awarded the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, and the Purple Heart fighting for his country in Vietnam.
One would have warning signs: increasing layoffs, rising energy prices, too many failing schools, persistent poverty, the stubborn vestiges of racism.
As good stewards, we must leave them better than we found them.
I'm personally aware of just how effective the mayor is.
So I look forward to coming to your city, to see your faith-based programs in action.
Nations making progress toward freedom will find America is their friend.
And as we transform our military, we can discard cold war relics and reduce our own nuclear forces to reflect today's needs.
First, we must be good stewards of this economy and renew the great institutions on which millions of our fellow citizens rely.
To make our economy stronger and more competitive, America must reward, not punish, the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs.
I ask Congress to move forward on a comprehensive health care agenda with tax credits to help low-income workers buy insurance, a community health center in every poor county, improved information technology to prevent medical error and needless costs, association health plans for small businesses and their employees, expanded health savings accounts, and medical liability reform that will reduce health care costs and make sure patients have the doctors and care they need.
The system, however, on its current path, is headed toward bankruptcy.
And every year afterward will bring a new shortfall, bigger than the year before.
Pursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror, and I thank the Congress for providing our service men and women with the resources they have needed.
During this time of war, we must continue to support our military and give them the tools for victory.
Our enemies know this, and that is why the terrorist Zarqawi recently declared war on what he called the "evil principle" of democracy.
And the great and proud nation of Egypt, which showed the way toward peace in the Middle East, can now show the way toward democracy in the Middle East.
That country is a vital front in the war on terror, which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a stand there.
And the victory of freedom in Iraq will strengthen a new ally in the war on terror, inspire democratic reformers from Damascus to Tehran, bring more hope and progress to a troubled region, and thereby lift a terrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren.
Our generation has dreams of its own, and we also go forward with confidence.
I say this not to lay blame or to look backwards, but because it is only by understanding how we arrived at this moment that we'll be able to lift ourselves out of this predicament.
I will not send--I will not spend a single penny for the purpose of rewarding a single Wall Street executive, but I will do whatever it takes to help the small business that can't pay its workers or the family that has saved and still can't get a mortgage.
It is time to put in place tough, new, commonsense rules of the road so that our financial market rewards drive and innovation, and punishes shortcuts and abuse.
In the midst of Civil War, we laid railroad tracks from one coast to another that spurred commerce and industry.
In the wake of war and depression, the GI bill sent a generation to college and created the largest middle class in history.
We do what's necessary to move this country forward.
And that is why this budget creates new teachers--new incentives for teacher performance, pathways for advancement, and rewards for success.
And to encourage a renewed spirit of national service for this and future generations, I ask Congress to send me the bipartisan legislation that bears the name of Senator Orrin Hatch, as well as an American who has never stopped asking what he can do for his country, Senator Edward Kennedy.
We'll eliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq and reform our defense budget so that we're not paying for cold war-era weapons systems we don't use.
For 7 years, we have been a nation at war.
Along with our outstanding national security team, I'm now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars, and I will soon announce a way forward in Iraq that leaves Iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war.

As a result, we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances.
Now, a year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act that independent economists said would create more than 1 million new jobs.
A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the-art lab where new workers are mastering the 3-D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything.
And we'll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers and create classes that focus on science, technology, engineering, and math: the skills today's employers are looking for to fill the jobs that are there right now and will be there in the future.
We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day's work with honest wages.
This drawdown will continue, and by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over.
We'll invest in new capabilities, even as we reduce waste and wartime spending.
We will keep faith with our veterans, investing in world-class care—including mental health care—for our wounded warriors, supporting our military families, giving our veterans the benefits and education and job opportunities that they have earned.
Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets, because these police chiefs, they're tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned.
Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and citizens of America: Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation's path towards civil rights and the work that still remains to be done.
Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.
Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war.

We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars that dethroned fascism, and a cold war, and defeated communism.
We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world—all across the world.
We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.
Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars.
