We have reconfirmed our commitment to the defense of Europe, and this year we will demonstrate that commitment by further modernizing and strengthening our military capabilities there.
For 30 years, concerted but unsuccessful efforts have been made to ban the testing of atomic explosives—both military weapons and peaceful nuclear devices.
We retain the permanent right to defend the canal with our own military forces, if necessary, to guarantee its openness and its neutrality.
We are seeking to readjust our military presence in Korea by reducing our ground forces on the Peninsula and undertaking compensatory measures to ensure that an adequate balance of forces remain.
Our military defenses are strong and growing stronger.
America's military power is a major force for security and stability in the world.
But our national security in this complicated age requires more than just military might.
Our white collar, blue collar, and military systems must be reformed in order to make certain that we neither overpay nor underpay Federal employees.
AMERICA'S MILITARY STRENGTH    Elsewhere in this report I have described the domestic programs and policies required for a just, united and productive America.
The maintenance of American military strength is an essential foundation for a successful foreign policy that safeguards our freedom, our accomplishments and our friendships.
In a world of accelerating change, fraught with potential danger and uncertainty, and marked by a continuing Soviet military buildup, we must have, together with our allies, unsurpassed military capability to deter attack or attempts at political coercion.
Moreover, we must have the military force to mount an effective defense at any level of hostilities where our vital interests are jeopardized.
The defense budget which I have presented to the Congress funds a program of prudent investments that will ensure the effectiveness of our strategic and conventional military posture.
In addition, the defense budget I have submitted this week will strengthen our conventional capabilities to fulfill our commitments to our major allies and friends and retain a credible military presence in both the Atlantic and the Pacific.
The LTDP will increase NATO military capabilities through better coordination of defense efforts, increased investment, and more modern equipment.
• We removed, with the support of Congress, a serious obstacle to strengthening Turkey's defensive capabilities and made further progress toward the reintegration of Greek armed forces into NATO's military structure; both these efforts helped repair a serious deficiency on NATO's southern flank.
The provision of adequate military as well as economic assistance to Turkey, Portugal and other allies and friends in need will be a matter of high priority during the coming year.
We also intend to maintain a vigorous American military presence in the Pacific.
Successful completion of a revised military base agreement in the Philippines, following ten years of negotiations, provides an essential underpinning for our military capability in Asia.
Congressional authorization for the transfer of military equipment to the Republic of Korea was another contribution to assuring the security of Korea and Japan.
The essential task of improving our military posture must also be accompanied by increased efficiency.
Vigorous cost-saving efforts will continue this year in order to assure that the United States will possess strong military forces at the lowest possible cost.
BUILDING THE COMMUNITY' OF NATIONS    Military strength is essential to peace but cannot alone guarantee it.
Our military forces are strong and growing stronger.
As in the previous three years, I will be working with you toward the basic goals of:    • Ensuring our economic strength;    • Creating energy security for our nation;    • Enhancing basic human and social needs;    • Making our government more efficient and effective;    • Protecting and enhancing our rights and liberties;    • Preserving and developing our natural resources;    • Building America's military strength;    • Working to resolve international disputes through peaceful means;    • Striving to resolve pressing international economic problems;    • Continuing to support the building of democratic institutions and protecting human rights; and    • Preventing the spread and further development of nuclear weapons.
CONTINUING TO SUPPORT THE BUILDING, OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS    AND PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS    • Special International Security Assistance for Pakistan—I am sending to Congress a military and economic assistance program to enable Pakistan to strengthen its defenses.
Our white collar, blue collar and military compensation systems must be reformed in order to make certain that we neither overpay nor underpay Federal employees.
We prepared for this conference for over two years; our delegation has secured for the United States all allocations necessary for its civilian and military services while also responding to the legitimate needs of the Third World nations.
I see five basic goals for America in the world over the 1980's:    —First, we will continue, as we have over the past three years, to build America's military strength and that of our allies and friends.
We must have both the military power and the political will to deter our adversaries and to support our friends and allies.
That price has increased as the military power of our major adversary has grown and its readiness to use that power been made all too evident in Afghanistan.
Therefore, I am asking Congress, as the first order of business, to pass an economic and military aid package designed to assist Pakistan defend itself.
DEFENSE BUDGET    For many years the Soviets have steadily increased their real defense spending, expanded their strategic forces, strengthened their forces in Europe and Asia, and enhanced their capability for projecting military force around the world directly or through the use of proxies.
Afghanistan dramatizes the vastly increased military power of the Soviet Union.
The defense program emphasizes four areas:    (a) It ensures that our strategic nuclear forces will be equivalent to those of the Soviet Union and that deterrence against nuclear war will be maintained;    (b) It upgrades our forces so that the military balance between NATO and the Warsaw Pact will continue to deter the outbreak of war—conventional or nuclear-in Europe;    (c) It provides us the ability to come quickly to the aid of friends and allies around the globe;    (d) And it ensures that our Navy will continue to be the most powerful on the seas.
In addition, responding to the Soviet military presence in Cuba and the proxy role of Cuba on behalf of the USSR, we have taken or are taking the following actions in support of the rapid deployment force:    (1) We are substantially increasing our ability to monitor Cuban and Soviet/Cuban activities;    (2) We have established a Caribbean Joint Task Force Headquarters which improves our ability to respond to events in the region;    (3) We are increasing regional military exercises; and,    (4) We are intensifying assistance to countries in the region that are threatened by Soviet or Cuban intervention.
The program I have proposed will assure the ability of our Navy to operate in high threat areas, to maintain control of the seas and protect vital lines of communication-both military and economic-and to provide the strong maritime component of our rapid deployment forces.
MILITARY PERSONNEL    No matter how capable or advanced our weapons systems, our military security depends on the abilities, the training and the dedication of the people who serve in our armed forces.
I am determined to recruit and to retain under any foreseeable circumstances an ample level of such skilled and experienced military personnel.
In the Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction talks, we and our allies have recently put forward new proposals that are designed to simplify the negotiations and improve the prospect for early progress in limiting conventional military forces in Europe.
NATO's consensus in favor of modernizing and negotiating about its nuclear arsenal while continuing to improve conventional forces, dramatized Allied capacity to respond effectively to both the military and political threats posed by the Soviet Union.
This action, though indispensable in its own right, also supported our continuing efforts to promote a solution to the Cyprus problem and to bring about the reintegration of Greece within the military framework of the Atlantic Alliance, objectives which retain high priority this year.
We have maintained that balance through a strong United States military posture in the region, as well as close ties with our allies, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Korea.
Over the past year I have worked to stabilize the United States military presence in Asia by concluding an amended base agreement with the Philippines that will last until 1991.
After examining in detail new intelligence estimates of North Korean military strength, I decided to maintain our troop strength in the Republic of Korea at its present level until at least 1981.
In the past year, we have begun to increase our capacity to project military power into the Persian Gulf region, and are engaged in explorations of increased use of military facilities in the area.
In this new situation, we are proposing to the Congress a military and economic assistance program to enable Pakistan to buttress its defenses.
We are also pursuing the possibility of gaining access to military facilities in the region in time of trouble.
These two acts—one of international terrorism and one of military aggression-present a serious challenge to the United States of America and indeed to all the nations of the world.
Three basic developments have helped to shape our challenges: the steady growth and increased projection of Soviet military power beyond its own borders; the overwhelming dependence of the Western democracies on oil supplies from the Middle East; and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world, exemplified by the revolution in Iran.
But now we face a broader and more fundamental challenge in this region because of the recent military action of the Soviet Union.
In all these actions, we have maintained two commitments: to be ready to meet any challenge by Soviet military power, and to develop ways to resolve disputes and to keep the peace.
We superpowers also have the responsibility to exercise restraint in the use of our great military force.
It's using its great military power against a relatively defenseless nation.
The Soviet Union must realize that its decision to use military force in Afghanistan will be costly to every political and economic relationship it values.
The Soviet effort to dominate Afghanistan has brought Soviet military forces to within 300 miles of the Indian Ocean and close to the Straits of Hormuz, a waterway through which most of the world's oil must flow.
Meeting this challenge will take national will, diplomatic and political wisdom, economic sacrifice, and, of course, military capability.
Let our position be absolutely clear: An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force.
I'm also working, along with the leaders of other nations, to provide additional military and economic aid for Pakistan.
In the weeks ahead, we will further strengthen political and military ties with other nations in the region.
The Administration's space policy reaffirmed the separation of military space systems and the open civil space program, and at the same time, provided new guidance on technology transfer between the civil and military programs.
In addition, because ocean observations from space can meet common civil and military data requirements, a National Oceanic Satellite System has been proposed as a major FY 1981 new start.
I see six basic goals for America in the world over the 1980's:    • First, we will continue, as we have over the past four years, to build America's military strength and that of our allies and friends.
Enhancing National Security—American Military Strength    The maintenance of national security is my first concern, as it has been for every president before me.
We must have both the military power and the political will to deter our adversaries and to support our friends and allies.
That price has increased as the military power of our major adversary has grown and its readiness to use that power been made all too evident in Afghanistan.
The Soviet Union has completed preparations for a possible military intervention against Poland.
DEFENSE BUDGET    For many years the Soviets have steadily increased their real defense spending, expanded their strategic forces, strengthened their forces in Europe and Asia, and enhanced their capability for projecting military force around the world directly or through the use of proxies.
Afghanistan dramatizes the vastly increased military power of the Soviet Union.
The defense program emphasizes four areas:    • It ensures that our strategic nuclear forces will be equivalent to those of the Soviet Union and that deterrence against nuclear war will be maintained;    • It upgrades our forces so that the military balance between NATO and the Warsaw Pact will continue to deter the outbreak of war—conventional or nuclear-in Europe;    • It provides us the ability to come quickly to the aid of friends and allies around the globe;    • And it ensures that our Navy will continue to be the most powerful on the seas.
Rather, the need for change is driven by the inexorable buildup of Soviet military power and the increasing propensity of Soviet leaders to use this power in coercion and outright aggression to impose their will on others.
As such they confront not only Soviet military forces but also Soviet military doctrine.
The program I have proposed will assure the ability of our Navy to operate in high threat areas, to maintain control of the seas and protect vital lines of communication-both military and economic-and to provide the strong maritime component of our rapid deployment forces.
MILITARY PERSONNEL    No matter how capable or advanced our weapons systems, our military security depends on the abilities, the training and the dedication of the people who serve in our armed forces.
I am determined to recruit and to retain under any foreseeable circumstances an ample level of such skilled and experienced military personnel.
This Administration has supported for FY 1981 the largest peacetime increase ever in military pay and allowances.
We regretted that massive political and internal security problems led the Turkish military to take over the government on September 12.
The tradition of the Turkish military gives us cause to take that pledge seriously.
We welcomed the reestablishment of Greece's links to the integrated military command structure of the Atlantic Alliance—a move which we had strongly encouraged—as a major step toward strengthening NATO's vital southern flank at a time of international crisis and tension in adjacent areas.
In response, we have reiterated our security commitment to Thailand and have provided emergency security assistance for Thai forces facing a Vietnamese military threat along the Thai-Cambodian border.
We have amended our military base agreement with the Philippines, ensuring stable access to these bases through 1991.
We have also embarked on a course to reinforce the trust and confidence our regional friends have in our ability to come to their assistance rapidly with American military force if needed.
The Department of Defense came up with a number of cuts which reduce the budget increase needed to restore our military balance.
I know that you're all aware—but I think it bears saying again—that since 1970 the Soviet Union has invested $300 billion more in its military forces than we have.
As a result of its massive military buildup, the Soviets have made a significant numerical advantage in strategic nuclear delivery systems, tactical aircraft, submarines, artillery, and anti-aircraft defense.
Together we've begun to restore that margin of military safety that ensures peace.
By restoring America's military credibility, by pursuing peace at the negotiating table wherever both sides are willing to sit down in good faith, and by regaining the respect of America's allies and adversaries alike, we have strengthened our country's position as a force for peace and progress in the world.
Our sanctions against the military dictatorship that has attempted to crush human rights in Poland—and against the Soviet regime behind that military dictatorship-clearly demonstrated to the world that America will not conduct "business as usual" with the forces of oppression.
Meanwhile, we're working for reduction of arms and military activities, as I announced in my address to the Nation last November 18th.
We have proposed to the Soviet Union a far-reaching agenda for mutual reduction of military forces and have already initiated negotiations with them in Geneva on intermediate-range nuclear forces.
In the last decade, while we sought the moderation of Soviet power through a process of restraint and accommodation, the Soviets engaged in an unrelenting buildup of their military forces.
The protection of our national security has required that we undertake a substantial program to enhance our military forces.
I will, also, propose a 1-year freeze on a broad range of domestic spending programs, and for Federal civilian and military pay and pension programs.
And let me say right here, I'm sorry, with regard to the military, in asking that of them, because for so many years they have been so far behind and so low in reward for what the men and women in uniform are doing.
But our strategy for peace with freedom must also be based on strength—economic strength and military strength.
We have developed a realistic military strategy to deter threats to peace and to protect freedom if deterrence fails.
The Congress deserves America's thanks for helping us restore pride and credibility to our military.
And then came several years in which our military capability was allowed to deteriorate to a very dangerous degree.
A rebirth of bipartisan cooperation, of economic growth, and military deterrence, and a growing spirit of unity among our people at home and our allies abroad underline a fundamental and far-reaching change: The United States is safer, stronger, and more secure in 1984 than before.
Second, we must not relax our efforts to restore military strength just as we near our goal of a fully equipped, trained, and ready professional corps.
You know, we only have a military-industrial complex until a time of danger, and then it becomes the arsenal of democracy.
Just 10 years from the time she left Vietnam, she will graduate from the United States Military Academy at West Point.
Since 1970 the Soviets have invested $500 billion more on their military forces than we have.
In light of the compelling need to reduce the deficit, however, I support a 1-year freeze in the military budget, something I proposed last fall in my flexible freeze plan.
And frankly -- and don't take this wrong -- we need less congressional micromanagement of our nation's military policy.
The fundamental facts remain that the Soviets retain a very powerful military machine in the service of objectives which are still too often in conflict with ours.
The number of military personnel in Panama is now very close to what it was before the operation began.
We recognize that the Soviet military threat in Europe is diminishing, but we see little change in Soviet strategic modernization.
I agree with our European allies that an American military presence in Europe is essential and that it should not be tied solely to the Soviet military presence in Eastern Europe.
This level reflects the advice of our senior military advisers.
The quality of American technology, thanks to the American worker, has enabled us to successfully deal with difficult military conditions and help minimize precious loss of life.
Two years ago, I began planning cuts in military spending that reflected the changes of the new era.
I believe we can do better because we remain the greatest nation on Earth, the world's strongest economy, the world's only military superpower.
As we restructure our military forces to meet the new threats of the post-cold-war world, it is true that we can responsibly reduce our defense budget.
Our forces are the finest military our Nation has ever had.
With our allies we have created a Partnership For Peace that invites states from the former Soviet bloc and other non-NATO members to work with NATO in military cooperation.
And this year, because of our work together, enacting NAFTA, keeping our military strong and prepared, supporting democracy abroad, we have reaffirmed America's leadership, America's engagement.
You have before you crime legislation which also establishes a police corps to encourage young people to get an education and pay it off by serving as police officers; which encourages retiring military personnel to move into police forces, an inordinate resource for our country; one which has a safe schools provision which will give our young people the chance to walk to school in safety and to be in school in safety instead of dodging bullets.
From the day I took the oath of office, I pledged that our Nation would maintain the best equipped, best trained, and best prepared military on Earth.
But to make sure our military is ready for action and to provide the pay and the quality of life the military and their families deserve, I'm asking the Congress to add $25 billion in defense spending over the next 6 years.
Tonight I am nominating him, a hero of the Persian Gulf war and the commander in chief of the United States Military Southern Command, General Barry McCaffrey, as America's new drug czar.
By keeping our military strong, by using diplomacy where we can and force where we must, by working with others to share the risk and the cost of our efforts, America is making a difference for people here and around the world.
We must maintain a strong and ready military.
You know, we help communities in a special way when their military base closes; we ought to help them in the same way if their factory closes.
We see it today in the United States military, in the Peace Corps, in AmeriCorps.
Since April, together we have added nearly $6 billion to maintain our military readiness.
Another picture would be full of blessings: a balanced budget, big surpluses, a military that is second to none, a country at peace with its neighbors, technology that is revolutionizing the world, and our greatest strength, concerned citizens who care for our country and care for each other.
The budget I propose to you also supports the people who keep our country strong and free, the men and women who serve in the United States military.
America's veterans honored their commitment to our country through their military service.
We will promote the peace, and we need a strong military to keep the peace.
But our military was shaped to confront the challenges of the past.
And as we transform our military, we can discard cold war relics and reduce our own nuclear forces to reflect today's needs.
Our progress is a tribute to the spirit of the Afghan people, to the resolve of our coalition, and to the might of the United States military.
Our military has put the terror training camps of Afghanistan out of business, yet camps still exist in at least a dozen countries.
While the most visible military action is in Afghanistan, America is acting elsewhere.
We need to replace aging aircraft and make our military more agile to put our troops anywhere in the world quickly and safely.
America and coalition countries have uncovered and stopped terrorist conspiracies targeting the Embassy in Yemen, the American Embassy in Singapore, a Saudi military base, ships in the Straits of Hormuz and the Straits of Gibraltar.
Nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these weapons, not economic sanctions, not isolation from the civilized world, not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities.
And if war is forced upon us, we will fight with the full force and might of the United States military, and we will prevail.
Thousands of very skilled and determined military personnel are on the manhunt, going after the remaining killers who hide in cities and caves, and one by one, we will bring these terrorists to justice.
And the men and women of the American military—they have taken the hardest duty.
During this time of war, we must continue to support our military and give them the tools for victory.
He and all Iraqis can be certain: While our military strategy is adapting to circumstances, our commitment remains firm and unchanging.
The volunteers of our military are unrelenting in battle, unwavering in loyalty, unmatched in honor and decency, and every day they're making our Nation more secure.
Ladies and gentlemen, with grateful hearts we honor freedom's defenders and our military families, represented here this evening by Sergeant Norwood's mom and dad, Janet and Bill Norwood.
Lacking the military strength to challenge us directly, the terrorists have chosen the weapon of fear.
I am confident in our plan for victory; I am confident in the will of the Iraqi people; I am confident in the skill and spirit of our military.
But those decisions will be made by our military commanders, not by politicians in Washington, DC.
We've adjusted our military tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction.
Members of Congress, however we feel about the decisions and debates of the past, our Nation has only one option: We must keep our word, defeat our enemies, and stand behind the American military in this vital mission.
And as we honor our brave troops, let us never forget the sacrifices of America's military families.
Our offensive against terror involves more than military action.
Fortunately, this Nation has superb professionals in law enforcement, intelligence, the military, and homeland security.
And so it remains the policy of this Government to use every lawful and proper tool of intelligence, diplomacy, law enforcement, and military action to do our duty, to find these enemies, and to protect the American people.
My fellow citizens, our military commanders and I have carefully weighed the options.
And one of the first steps we can take together is to add to the ranks of our military so that the American Armed Forces are ready for all the challenges ahead.
Such a corps would function much like our military reserve.
Thanks to the courage of these military and civilian personnel, a nation that was once a safe haven for Al Qaida is now a young democracy where boys and girls are going to school, new roads and hospitals are being built, and people are looking to the future with new hope.
Our military and civilians in Iraq are performing with courage and distinction, and they have the gratitude of our whole Nation.
Protecting our Nation from the dangers of a new century requires more than good intelligence and a strong military.
Our military families also sacrifice for America.
So I ask you to join me in expanding their access to child care, creating new hiring preferences for military spouses across the Federal Government, and allowing our troops to transfer their unused education benefits to their spouses or children.
Our military families serve our Nation, they inspire our Nation, and tonight our Nation honors them.
And that's why Michelle has joined with Jill Biden to forge a national commitment to support military families.
This year, I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are.
The Secretary of Defense has also agreed to cut tens of billions of dollars in spending that he and his generals believe our military can do without.
And with that change, I call on all our college campuses to open their doors to our military recruiters and ROTC.
Our ironclad commitment--and I mean ironclad--to Israel's security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history.
That's why, working with our military leaders, I've proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget.
These sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness.
As long as I'm Commander in Chief, we will do whatever we must to protect those who serve their country abroad, and we will maintain the best military the world has ever known.
We will keep faith with our veterans, investing in world-class care—including mental health care—for our wounded warriors, supporting our military families, giving our veterans the benefits and education and job opportunities that they have earned.
Jill Biden for their continued dedication to serving our military families as well as they have served us.
Defending our freedom, though, is not just the job of our military alone.
The Joining Forces alliance that Michelle and Jill Biden launched has already encouraged employers to hire or train nearly 400,000 veterans and military spouses.
But I strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our outstanding military alone.
Because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military actions, but by remaining true to our constitutional ideals and setting an example for the rest of the world.
On every issue, the world turns to us, not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might, but because of the ideals we stand for and the burdens we bear to advance them.
And we will all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families.
And Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden—[applause]—thank you, Michelle; thank you, Jill—has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get a new job.
When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads, when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military, then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world.
We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy, when we leverage our power with coalition building, when we don't let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents.
In Iraq and Syria, American leadership—including our military power—is stopping ISIL's advance.
[Laughter] You will be pretty lonely, because you'll be debating our military, most of America's business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it's a problem and intend to solve it.
We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined.
If this Congress is serious about winning this war and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, authorize the use of military force against ISIL.
Our military, our doctors, our development workers—they were heroic; they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic.
Leadership means a wise application of military power and rallying the world behind causes that are right.
Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.
We have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and nonessential Federal workers.
My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable; to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave; to invest in women's health; and to promote clean air and clean water; and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.
Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war.
I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.
We expect our partners—whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific—to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.
