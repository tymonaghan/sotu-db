Almost 8 million Americans are out of work.
The threats of layoff and unemployment hang over other millions, and all who work are frustrated by their inability to keep up with inflation.
Not only have hourly earnings of the American worker, after adjusting for inflation, declined 5 percent over the past 5 years, but in these 5 years, Federal personal taxes for the average family have increased 67 percent.
This, plus strong and effective work requirements, will save $520 million in the next year.
The Trade Adjustment Assistance program provides benefits for workers who are unemployed when foreign imports reduce the market for various American products, causing shutdown of plants and layoff of workers.
The purpose is to help these workers find jobs in growing sectors of our economy.
Now, we know of course that the categorical grant programs burden local and State governments with a mass of Federal regulations and Federal paperwork.
And that can only be done with a tax program which provides incentive to increase productivity for both workers and industry.
The average worker's wage will rise in real purchasing power 8 percent, and this is in after-tax dollars.
These won't be make-work jobs.
I'm well aware that there are many other desirable and needed tax changes, such as indexing the income tax brackets to protect taxpayers against inflation; the unjust discrimination against married couples if both are working and earning; tuition tax credits; the unfairness of the inheritance tax, especially to the family-owned farm and the family-owned business; and a number of others.
We've tried that, and surely we must be able to see it doesn't work.
Over 7 million man and woman hours of work by State and local officials are required to fill out government forms.
We don't have an option of living with inflation and its attendant tragedy, millions of productive people willing and able to work but unable to find a buyer for their work in the job market.
Our progress began not in Washington, DC, but in the hearts of our families, communities, workplaces, and voluntary groups which, together, are unleashing the invincible spirit of one great nation under God.
New freedom in our lives has planted the rich seeds for future success:    For an America of wisdom that honors the family, knowing that if [as] the family goes, so goes our civilization;    For an America of vision that sees tomorrow's dreams in the learning and hard work we do today;    For an America of courage whose service men and women, even as we meet, proudly stand watch on the frontiers of freedom;    For an America of compassion that opens its heart to those who cry out for help.
We're here to speak for the American farmer, the entrepreneur, and every worker in industries fighting to modernize and compete.
Our automobile industry has overhauled assembly lines, increased worker productivity, and is competitive once again.
And tonight, I am instructing Treasury Secretary James Baker—I have to get used to saying that—to begin working with congressional authors and committees for bipartisan legislation conforming to these principles.
We can help teenagers, who have the highest unemployment rate, find summer jobs, so they can know the pride of work and have confidence in their futures.
Credits in education and health care vouchers will help working families shop for services that they need.
Now we're going to develop a permanently manned space station and new opportunities for free enterprise, because in the next decade Americans and our friends around the world will be living and working together in space.
Of all the changes that have swept America the past 4 years, none brings greater promise than our rediscovery of the values of faith, freedom, family, work, and neighborhood.
We've rediscovered that work is good in and of itself, that it ennobles us to create and contribute no matter how seemingly humble our jobs.
We're stressing basics of discipline, rigorous testing, and homework, while helping children become computer-smart as well.
We must go forward in our commitment to the new basics, giving parents greater authority and making sure good teachers are rewarded for hard work and achievement through merit pay.
Our security assistance programs help friendly governments defend themselves and give them confidence to work for peace.
I want to work with you to support the democratic forces whose struggle is tied to our own security.
And 8 years ago, I sat in that very chair as President Reagan spoke of punishing inflation and devastatingly high interest rates and people out of work -- American confidence on the wane.
I make this pledge tonight: My team and I are ready to work with the Congress, to form a special leadership group, to negotiate in good faith, to work day and night -- if that's what it takes -- to meet the budget targets and to produce a budget on time.
And I will work for choice for American families, whether in the housing in which they live, the schools to which they send their children, or the child care they select for their young.
And I will work to knock down the barriers left by past discrimination and to build a more tolerant society that will stop such barriers from ever being built again.
I believe we should help working families cope with the burden of child care.
We will not miss any opportunity to work for peace.
And I'll work to strengthen the hand of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Our diplomacy must work every day against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
To those men and women in business, remember the ultimate end of your work: to make a better product, to create better lives.
We will work with you to open foreign markets to American agricultural products.
Check on the homework, go to the school, meet the teachers, care about what is happening there.
We need your talents in America's work force.
At a workers' rally, in a place called Branik on the outskirts of Prague, the idea called America is alive.
A worker, dressed in grimy overalls, rises to speak at the factory gates.
And our challenge today is to take this democratic system of ours, a system second to none, and make it better: a better America, where there's a job for everyone who wants one; where women working outside the home can be confident their children are in safe and loving care and where government works to expand child-care alternatives for parents; where we reconcile the needs of a clean environment and a strong economy; where "Made in the USA" is recognized around the world as the symbol of quality and progress; where every one of us enjoys the same opportunities to live, to work, and to contribute to society and where, for the first time, the American mainstream includes all of our disabled citizens; where everyone has a roof over his head and where the homeless get the help they need to live in dignity; where our schools challenge and support our kids and our teachers and where all of them make the grade; where every street, every city, every school, and every child is drug-free; and finally, where no American is forgotten -- our hearts go out to our hostages who are ceaselessly on our minds and in our efforts.
This administration is determined to encourage the creation of capital, capital of all kinds: physical capital -- everything from our farms and factories to our workshops and production lines, all that is needed to produce and deliver quality goods and quality services; intellectual capital -- the source of ideas that spark tomorrow's products; and of course our human capital -- the talented work force that we'll need to compete in the global market.
Let me tell you, if we ignore human capital, if we lose the spirit of American ingenuity, the spirit that is the hallmark of the American worker, that would be bad.
The American worker is the most productive worker in the world.
Every American adult must be a skilled, literate worker and citizen.
There is work to do, and they sent us here to get it done.
Let's work together to do the will of the people: clean air, child care, the Educational Excellence Act, crime, and drugs.
We've got to take the time after a busy day to sit down and read with our kids, help them with their homework, pass along the values we learned as children.
Six months ago, early in this season of change, I stood at the gates of the Gdansk shipyard in Poland at the monument to the fallen workers of Solidarity.
For two centuries, we've done the hard work of freedom.
Tonight, we work to achieve another victory, a victory over tyranny and savage aggression.
We are Americans; we have a unique responsibility to do the hard work of freedom.
And when we do, freedom works.
Do the hard work of freedom.
You and I know that if the playing field is level, America's workers and farmers can out-work, out-produce anyone, anytime, anywhere.
Working with Congress and the Governors, I propose we select at least $15 billion in such programs and turn them over to the States in a single consolidated grant, fully funded, for flexible management by the States.
There is no one more devoted, more committed to the hard work of freedom than every soldier and sailor, every marine, airman, and coastguardsman, every man and woman now serving in the Persian Gulf.
We worked hard to avoid war.
Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar; Presidents Gorbachev, Mitterrand, Ozal, Mubarak, and Bendjedid; Kings Fahd and Hassan; Prime Ministers Major and Andreotti -- just to name a few -- all worked for a solution.
The quality of American technology, thanks to the American worker, has enabled us to successfully deal with difficult military conditions and help minimize precious loss of life.
Our people have never wanted to abandon the blessings of home and work for distant lands and deadly conflict.
We move toward the next century more confident than ever that we have the will at home and abroad to do what must be done -- the hard work of freedom.
Further, for the untold number of hard-working, responsible American workers and business men and women who've been forced to go without needed bank loans, the banking credit crunch must end.
Finally, working with the Federal Reserve, we will continue to support monetary policy that keeps both interest rates and inflation down.
This will encourage businesses to accelerate investment and bring people back to work.
Once building starts, carpenters and plumbers work; people buy homes and take out mortgages.
First, trade: We will work to break down the walls that stop world trade.
We will work to open markets everywhere.
And in our major trade negotiations, I will continue pushing to eliminate tariffs and subsidies that damage America's farmers and workers.
The workplace of the future will demand more highly skilled workers than ever, more people who are computer-literate, highly educated.
Surely a tired woman on her way to work at 6 in the morning on a subway deserves the right to get there safely.
States throughout the country are beginning to operate with new assumptions that when able-bodied people receive Government assistance, they have responsibilities to the taxpayer: A responsibility to seek work, education, or job training; a responsibility to get their lives in order; a responsibility to hold their families together and refrain from having children out of wedlock; and a responsibility to obey the law.
I want to add, as we make these changes, we work together to improve this system, that our intention is not scapegoating or finger-pointing.
Someone even said our workers are lazy and uninspired.
I believe we will find our new direction in the basic old values that brought us here over the last two centuries: a commitment to opportunity, to individual responsibility, to community, to work, to family, and to faith.
Second, it changes the rhetoric of the past into the actions of the present by honoring work and families in every part of our public decision-making.
And there's no recovery worth its salt that doesn't put the American people back to work.
To create jobs and guarantee a strong recovery, I call on Congress to enact an immediate package of jobs investments of over $30 billion to put people to work now, to create a half a million jobs: jobs to rebuild our highways and airports, to renovate housing, to bring new life to rural communities, and spread hope and opportunity among our Nation's youth.
Our plan is designed, furthermore, and perhaps in some ways most importantly, to improve the health of American business through lower interest rates, more incentives to invest, and better trained workers.
That's about 90 percent of the firms in America, employing about 40 percent of the work force but creating a big majority of the net new jobs for more than a decade.
With a new network of community development banks and $1 billion to make the dream of enterprise zones real, we propose to bring new hope and new jobs to storefronts and factories from south Boston to south Texas to south central Los Angeles.
And it provides the most ambitious environmental cleanup in partnership with State and local government of our time, to put people to work and to preserve the environment for our future.
And so, we will insist on fair trade rules in international markets as a part of a national economic strategy to expand trade, including the successful completion of the latest round of world trade talks and the successful completion of a North American Free Trade Agreement with appropriate safeguards for our workers and for the environment.
We must provide special assistance to areas and to workers displaced by cuts in the defense budget and by other unavoidable economic dislocations.
I pledge to you that I will do my best to see that business and labor and Government work together for a change.
Later this spring, after the First Lady and the many good people who are helping her all across the country complete their work, I will deliver to Congress a comprehensive plan for health care reform that finally will bring costs under control and provide security to all of our families, so that no one will be denied the coverage they need but so that our economic future will not be compromised either.
We'll have to root out fraud and overcharges and make sure that paperwork no longer chokes your doctor.
Let me further say that I want to work with all of you on this.
And I will work to do better.
Yes, we must give them the resources they need to meet high standards, but we must also use the authority and the influence and the funding of the Education Department to promote strategies that really work in learning.
We have to do what really works to increase learning in our schools.
Lifelong learning must benefit not just young high school graduates but workers, too, throughout their career.
We have done a lot in this country on worker training in the last few years, but the system is too fractured.
We must develop a unified, simplified, sensible, streamlined worker-training program so that workers receive the training they need regardless of why they lost their jobs or whether they simply need to learn something new to keep them.
And finally, I propose a program that got a great response from the American people all across this country last year: a program of national service to make college loans available to all Americans and to challenge them at the same time to give something back to their country as teachers or police officers or community service workers; to give them the option to pay the loans back, but at tax time so they can't beat the bill, but to encourage them instead to pay it back by making their country stronger and making their country better and giving us the benefit of their knowledge.
If we believe in jobs and we believe in learning, we must believe in rewarding work.
If we believe in restoring the values that make America special, we must believe that there is dignity in all work, and there must be dignity for all workers.
We will reward the work of millions of working poor Americans by realizing the principle that if you work 40 hours a week and you've got a child in the house, you will no longer be in poverty.
I have worked on this issue for the better part of a decade.
I want to offer the people on welfare the education, the training, the child care, the health care they need to get back on their feet, but say after 2 years they must get back to work, too, in private business if possible, in public service if necessary.
We must begin again to make Government work for ordinary taxpayers, not simply for organized interest groups.
Finally, let me say to my friends on both sides of the aisle, it is not enough simply to cut Government; we have to rethink the whole way it works.
When I became President I was amazed at just the way the White House worked, in ways that added lots of money to what taxpayers had to pay, outmoded ways that didn't take maximum advantage of technology and didn't do things that any business would have done years ago to save taxpayers' money.
Some things work, and some things don't.
We ought to be subsidizing the things that work and discouraging the things that don't.
We cut the deficit so that our children will be able to buy a home, so that our companies can invest in the future and in retraining their workers, so that our Government can make the kinds of investments we need to be a stronger and smarter and safer nation.
Unlike a carbon tax, that's not too hard on the coal States; unlike a gas tax, that's not too tough on people who drive a long way to work; unlike an ad valorem tax, it doesn't increase just when the price of an energy source goes up.
Our people will be watching and wondering, not to see whether you disagree with me on a particular issue but just to see whether this is going to be business as usual or a real new day, whether we're all going to conduct ourselves as if we know we're working for them.
If we work hard and if we work together, if we rededicate ourselves to creating jobs, to rewarding work, to strengthening our families, to reinventing our Government, we can lift our country's fortunes again.
The new promise of the global economy, the information age, unimagined new work, life-enhancing technology, all these are ours to seize.
So tonight I issue a call to action: action by this Congress, action by our States, by our people, to prepare America for the 21st century; action to keep our economy and our democracy strong and working for all our people; action to strengthen education and harness the forces of technology and science; action to build stronger families and stronger communities and a safer environment; action to keep America the world's strongest force for peace, freedom, and prosperity; and above all, action to build a more perfect Union here at home.
The spirit we bring to our work will make all the difference.
And we must work together.
It will balance the budget and build on the Vice President's efforts to make our Government work better, even as it costs less.
Let's work together to write bipartisan campaign finance reform into law and pass McCain-Feingold by the day we celebrate the birth of our democracy, July the fourth.
Then last year, Congress enacted landmark welfare reform legislation, demanding that all able-bodied recipients assume the responsibility of moving from welfare to work.
Now each and every one of us has to fulfill our responsibility, indeed, our moral obligation, to make sure that people who now must work, can work.
Here is my plan: Tax credits and other incentives for businesses that hire people off welfare; incentives for job placement firms and States to create more jobs for welfare recipients; training, transportation, and child care to help people go to work.
Give someone on welfare the chance to go to work.
Tonight I am pleased to announce that five major corporations, Sprint, Monsanto, UPS, Burger King, and United Airlines, will be the first to join in a new national effort to marshal America's businesses, large and small, to create jobs so that people can move from welfare to work.
And we must join together to do something else, too, something both Republican and Democratic Governors have asked us to do, to restore basic health and disability benefits when misfortune strikes immigrants who came to this country legally, who work hard, pay taxes, and obey the law.
Let's work together to meet these three goals: Every 8-year-old must be able to read; every 12-year-old must be able to log on to the Internet; every 18-year-old must be able to go to college; and every adult American must be able to keep on learning for a lifetime.
For years, many of our educators, led by North Carolina's Governor Jim Hunt and the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, have worked very hard to establish nationally accepted credentials for excellence in teaching.
We want at least 100,000 college students to help, and tonight I am pleased that 60 college presidents have answered my call, pledging that thousands of their work-study students will serve for one year as reading tutors.
I ask you to pass it and give every American who works hard the chance to go to college.
My "GI bill" for America's workers will transform the confusing tangle of Federal training programs into a simple skill grant to go directly into eligible workers' hands.
Let's give more of our workers the ability to learn and to earn for a lifetime.
We must build the second generation of the Internet so that our leading universities and national laboratories can communicate in speeds 1,000 times faster than today, to develop new medical treatments, new sources of energy, new ways of working together.
With new resources, NIH will now become the most powerful discovery engine for an AIDS vaccine, working with other scientists to finally end the threat of AIDS.
With new pressures on people in the way they work and live, I believe we must expand family leave so that workers can take time off for teacher conferences and a child's medical checkup.
We should pass flextime, so workers can choose to be paid for overtime in income or trade it in for time off to be with their families.
Ten million children still lack health insurance; 80 percent of them have working parents who pay taxes.
We should expand the network of community development banks.
And together we must pledge tonight that we will use this empowerment approach, including private-sector tax incentives, to renew our Capital City, so that Washington is a great place to work and live and once again the proud face America shows the world.
We must also protect our global environment, working to ban the worst toxic chemicals and to reduce the greenhouse gases that challenge our health even as they change our climate.
Our national service program, AmeriCorps, has already helped 70,000 young people to work their way through college as they serve America.
We should challenge all Americans in the arts and humanities to join with our fellow citizens to make the year 2000 a national celebration of the American spirit in every community, a celebration of our common culture in the century that has passed and in the new one to come in the new millennium, so that we can remain the world's beacon not only of liberty but of creativity long after the fireworks have faded.
I will go to China, and I have invited China's President to come here, not because we agree on everything but because engaging China is the best way to work on our common challenges like ending nuclear testing and to deal frankly with our fundamental differences like human rights.
We've worked hard to tear down trade barriers abroad so that we can create good jobs at home.
After all, we have the best workers and the best products.
We are working with other nations with renewed intensity to fight drug traffickers and to stop terrorists before they act and hold them fully accountable if they do.
He's the proud son of two of the millions of Asian-American immigrants who have strengthened America with their hard work, family values, and good citizenship.
Tomorrow there will be just over 1,000 days until the year 2000; 1,000 days to prepare our people; 1,000 days to work together; 1,000 days to build a bridge to a land of new promise.
My fellow Americans, we have work to do.
And tonight I challenge and invite Congress to work with me to use the resources of one picture to repaint the other, to direct the advantages of our time to solve the problems of our people.
Yet, too much Government crowds out initiative and hard work, private charity and the private economy.
Many working Americans do not have health care coverage, so we will help them buy their own insurance with refundable tax credits.
My New Freedom Initiative for Americans with disabilities funds new technologies, expands opportunities to work, and makes our society more welcoming.
We must encourage and support the work of charities and faith-based and community groups that offer help and love, one person at a time.
These groups are working in every neighborhood in America to fight homelessness and addiction and domestic violence, to provide a hot meal or a mentor or a safe haven for our children.
But our Nation should support the good works of these good people who are helping their neighbors in need.
In so doing, we will not hinder the work of our Nation's brave police officers.
Steven is the network administrator for a school district.
Right now, complicated tax rules punish hard work.
We must honor hard work, never punish it.
So I want to work with you to give our economy an important jump-start by making tax relief retroactive.
We will work with our allies and friends to be a force for good and a champion of freedom.
We will work for free markets, free trade, and freedom from oppression.
I've asked Federal agencies to work with California officials to help speed construction of new energy sources, and I have directed Vice President Cheney, Commerce Secretary Evans, Energy Secretary Abraham, and other senior members in my administration to develop a national energy policy.
The framework for reform has been developed by Senators Frist and Breaux and Congressman Thomas, and now is the time to act.
Reform should be based on these principles: It must preserve the benefits of all current retirees and those nearing retirement; it must return Social Security to sound financial footing; and it must offer personal savings accounts to younger workers who want them.
Social Security now offers workers a return of less than 2 percent on the money they pay into the system.
To save the system, we must increase that by allowing younger workers to make safe, sound investments that yield a higher rate of return.
And if we work together, we can prove that public service is noble.
Tonight, with a healthy, growing economy, with more Americans going back to work, with our Nation an active force for good in the world, the state of our Union is confident and strong.
We will help an additional 200,000 workers to get training for a better career by reforming our job training system and strengthening America's community colleges.
I ask Congress to move forward on a comprehensive health care agenda with tax credits to help low-income workers buy insurance, a community health center in every poor county, improved information technology to prevent medical error and needless costs, association health plans for small businesses and their employees, expanded health savings accounts, and medical liability reform that will reduce health care costs and make sure patients have the doctors and care they need.
And when their recommendations are delivered, you and I will work together to give this Nation a Tax Code that is progrowth, easy to understand, and fair to all.
We should not be content with laws that punish hard-working people who want only to provide for their families and deny businesses willing workers and invite chaos at our border.
It is time for an immigration policy that permits temporary-guest workers to fill jobs Americans will not take, that rejects amnesty, that tells us who is entering and leaving our country, and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists.
For younger workers, the Social Security system has serious problems that will grow worse with time.
And a half century ago, about 16 workers paid into the system for each person drawing benefits.
And instead of 16 workers paying in for every beneficiary, right now it's only about 3 workers.
And over the next few decades, that number will fall to just 2 workers per beneficiary.
With each passing year, fewer workers are paying ever-higher benefits to an ever-larger number of retirees.
I will work with Members of Congress to find the most effective combination of reforms.
And we must take care that any changes in the system are gradual, so younger workers have years to prepare and plan for their future.
As we fix Social Security, we also have the responsibility to make the system a better deal for younger workers.
Here is how the idea works.
If you're a younger worker, I believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account, so you can build a nest egg for your own future.
And we'll make sure this plan is fiscally responsible by starting personal retirement accounts gradually and raising the yearly limits on contributions over time, eventually permitting all workers to set aside 4 percentage points of their payroll taxes in their accounts.
Personal retirement accounts should be familiar to Federal employees, because you already have something similar called the Thrift Savings Plan, which lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any of five different broadly based investment funds.
I will work with Congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for experimentation or grown for body parts and that human life is never bought or sold as a commodity.
Police and firefighters, air marshals, researchers, and so many others are working every day to make our homeland safer, and we thank them all.
Our Nation, working with allies and friends, has also confronted the enemy abroad with measures that are determined, successful, and continuing.
The Al Qaida terror network that attacked our country still has leaders, but many of its top commanders have been removed.
We're working closely with the governments in Asia to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions.
To promote peace and stability in the broader Middle East, the United States will work with our friends in the region to fight the common threat of terror, while we encourage a higher standard of freedom.
We are working with European allies to make clear to the Iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program and any plutonium reprocessing and end its support for terror.
The new political situation in Iraq opens a new phase of our work in that country.
They exist in our laboratories and our universities, in our fields and our factories, in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest working people on Earth.
As soon as I took office, I asked this Congress to send me a recovery plan by President's Day that would put people back to work and put money in their pockets, not because I believe in bigger Government--I don't--not because I'm not mindful of the massive debt we've inherited--I am.
Because of this plan, 95 percent of working households in America will receive a tax cut; a tax cut that you will see in your paychecks beginning on April 1st.
Now, I know there are some in this Chamber and watching at home who are skeptical of whether this plan will work, and I understand that skepticism.
I will not send--I will not spend a single penny for the purpose of rewarding a single Wall Street executive, but I will do whatever it takes to help the small business that can't pay its workers or the family that has saved and still can't get a mortgage.
And then some company will hire workers to build it.
And then those workers will have money to spend.
And we will put Americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save billions of dollars on our energy bills.
When it was days old, this Congress passed a law to provide and protect health insurance for 11 million American children whose parents work full time.
Now, there will be many different opinions and ideas about how to achieve reform, and that's why I'm bringing together businesses and workers, doctors and health care providers, Democrats and Republicans to begin work on this issue next week.
It is our responsibility as lawmakers and as educators to make this system work.
In the end, there is no program or policy that can substitute for a parent, for a mother or father who will attend those parent-teacher conferences or help with homework or turn off the TV, put away the video games, read to their child.
In this budget, we will end education programs that don't work and end direct payments to large agribusiness that don't need them.
In fact--not a dime--in fact, the recovery plan provides a tax cut--that's right, a tax cut--for 95 percent of working families.
And to respond to an economic crisis that is global in scope, we are working with the nations of the G-20 to restore confidence in our financial system, avoid the possibility of escalating protectionism, and spur demand for American goods in markets across the globe.
I think of Leonard Abess, a bank president from Miami who reportedly cashed out of his company, took a $60 million bonus, and gave it out to all 399 people who worked for him, plus another 72 who used to work for him.
But we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded.
It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country: the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like or who you love.
It is our unfinished task to make sure that this Government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free enterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great Nation.
Now, our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget, decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery.
But we can't ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and the most powerful.
The American people deserve a Tax Code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms and more time expanding and hiring; a Tax Code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can't work the system and pay a lower rate than their hard-working secretaries; a Tax Code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that are creating jobs right here in the United States of America.
But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy, visit hardship on millions of hard-working Americans.
So let's set party interests aside and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future.
The American people have worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another.
But tonight I'll lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago.
A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the-art lab where new workers are mastering the 3-D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything.
And I ask this Congress to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made right here in America.
I urge this Congress to get together, pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago.
But I also want to work with this Congress to encourage the research and technology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and our water.
We'll work with the States to do it.
[Laughter]    So tonight I propose a Fix-It-First program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges across the country.
So tonight I propose working with States to make high-quality preschool available to every single child in America.
We know this works.
So let's do what works and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind.
It's a simple fact: The more education you've got, the more likely you are to have a good job and work your way into the middle class.
But we also have to make sure that America remains a place where everyone who's willing to work—everybody who's willing to work hard—has the chance to get ahead.
And as we speak, bipartisan groups in both Chambers are working diligently to draft a bill, and I applaud their efforts.
We know our economy is stronger when our wives, our mothers, our daughters can live their lives free from discrimination in the workplace and free from the fear of domestic violence.
We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day's work with honest wages.
But today, a full-time worker making the minimum wage earns $14,500 a year.
Tonight let's declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty and raise the Federal minimum wage to $9 an hour.
This single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families.
In fact, working folks shouldn't have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while CEO pay has never been higher.
