      <h3>Welcome to SOTU-db: State of the Union Database!</h3>
      <p>SOTU-db is a tool for measuring the sentiment (positive or negative context) of the texts of US President's State of the Union addresses, called "SOTUs" on this site.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>SOTU-db currently does four things:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Text Search:</b> enter a search term, find instances where it occurs in a sample of available SOTUs. Sentiment for each sentence, as measured by a variety of sentiment lexicons, is returned as well.</li>
        <li><b>Sentiment by Year:</b> select a year and chunk size from a sample of SOTUs. SOTU-db returns the sentiment per chunk of words (based on your chosen chunk size) and the cleaned text upon which the sentiment analysis was performed.</li>
        <li><b>File viewer:</b> View the clear (reading) text for a selection of SOTUs.</li>
        <li><b>Extras:</b> View supplementary works (writings, multimedia, games, etc) submitted by contributors.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please see <a href="html/documentation.html">"Documentation"</a> in the top navigation bar to learn more about the texts, sentiment, and more.</p>
      <p><i>SOTU-db is in a limited alpha release, so be sure to read the warnings to know what to expect.</i></p>
